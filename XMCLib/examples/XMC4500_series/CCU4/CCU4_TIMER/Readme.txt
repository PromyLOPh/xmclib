Description of example project
==============================
This example project depicts usage of SCU and CCU4 drivers.

The SCU driver is used to configure the clock settings and take the CCU4 peripheral 
out of reset. CCU4 APIs are used to configure a CCU4 slice to operate in timer mode. 
The timer start is externally triggered and the trigger originates from SCU.

In the ISRs of compare and period match events, interrupt counters are bumped up and 
the SCU is instructed to regenerate the trigger for start of the timer slice.  


Hardware Setup
===============
XMC4500 CPU board / XMC4500 Relax Kit 


How to test the application
============================
a. Import the project 
b. Compile and flash the application onto the device
c. Add g_num_period_interrupts and g_num_compare_interrupts to the watch window
d. Run the application. 
e. watch the two interrupt counters steadily increment

How to modify the application
==============================
a. To choose a different module.slice, please update the macros SLICE_PTR, MODULE_PTR, 
MODULE_NUMBER, SLICE_NUMBER and CAPCOM_MASK.

b. To test on a board which has a different crystal frequency, simply update the macro 
CRYSTAL_FREQUENCY to the correct value.
