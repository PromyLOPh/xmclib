Description of example project
==============================
Generate a PWM using the DMA
Using double buffering: while one buffer is used to update the PWM duty cycle the other buffer one can be updated using new values.

Hardware Setup
===============
XMC4800 Relax Kit 

How to test the application
============================
a. Import the project 
b. Compile and flash the application onto the device
c. Run the application. 
d. The duty cycle of the PWM signal in P0_15 changes every cycle
