Description of example project
==============================

HTTPSERVER

This is a demonstration of how to make the most basic kind 
of server using lWIP.

* httpserver-netconn.c - uses netconn and netbuf API

Hardware Setup
===============
XMC4700/XMC4800 Relaxkit 

How to test the application
============================
a. Copy the files to a new project
   The following directories need to be added to the compiler include paths:
   "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/cmsis_rtos_rtx/INC}"
   "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/cmsis_rtos_rtx/SRC}"
   "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/lwip/include}"
   "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/lwip/include/ipv4}"
   "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/lwip/port/cmsis-rtos/include}"
   "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/lwip/port/cmsis-rtos/netif}"
     
   The following macors need to be defined in the compiler settings:
     __CORTEX_M4F
     __FPU_PRESENT
     __CMSIS_RTOS

b. In the folder cmsis_rtos_rtx keep only the targer compiler folder, i.e. GCC  
c. Compile and flash the application onto the device
d. Run the application. 

The IP address of the board is manual configured using 192.168.0.10.
Reconfigure PC network address to something like 192.168.0.11.
